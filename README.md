# Flash Loan Simulator ‚Äì Aave-Style Atomic Loan Framework
This project demonstrates a minimal simulation of Aave-style flash loans using Solidity smart contracts. It allows developers to understand how flash loans work without requiring real liquidity pools.

## üöÄ Overview
Flash loans enable borrowing of assets with **no upfront collateral**, as long as the borrowed amount (plus a fee) is returned within the same transaction. If repayment fails, the entire transaction reverts.

This project includes:
- A **mintable ERC-20 token** (`FlashLoanTestToken`) to simulate liquidity.
- A **FlashLoanSimulator** contract that issues flash loans and enforces repayment.
- A **FlashLoanBorrower** contract that receives the loan and performs repayment logic.
- An interface (`IFlashLoanReceiver`) that ensures the borrower contract implements the required callback.

## üìÇ Contracts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ FlashLoanTestToken.sol
A simple ERC-20 token inheriting from OpenZeppelin's ERC20, with a public `mint()` function to create tokens for testing purposes.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ FlashLoanSimulator.sol
The lender contract:
- Issues flash loans to borrowers.
- Calls `executeOperation()` on the borrower.
- Requires repayment with a small fee in the same transaction.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ IFlashLoanReceiver.sol
An interface defining:
```solidity
This ensures standard interaction between the simulator and borrower contracts.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ FlashLoanBorrower.sol
Implements the `executeOperation()` callback and approves repayment to the simulator contract.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment and Testing

1. **Deploy `FlashLoanTestToken.sol`**
   - Constructor: `initialSupply = 0` (or any starting amount).

2. **Deploy `FlashLoanSimulator.sol`**
   - Constructor: pass the `FlashLoanTestToken` address.

3. **Deploy `FlashLoanBorrower.sol`**
   - Constructor: pass the `FlashLoanTestToken` and `FlashLoanSimulator` addresses.

4. **Mint tokens to the borrower contract**
   - Call `mint(borrowerAddress, amount)` on the token contract.

5. **Execute a flash loan**
   - Call `flashLoan(borrowerAddress, loanAmount)` on the simulator contract.

‚úÖ If repayment succeeds, the transaction completes.  
‚ùå If repayment fails, everything reverts.

## üìñ Learning Outcomes

This project helps you understand:
- How flash loans work at a low level.
- Atomicity (everything happens in one transaction or fails).
- How borrower contracts must implement standardized callbacks.
- How DeFi protocols enforce repayment logic.
